A set of tools to display and analyze database query planning and execution.

---

The JS bit was up and running on dbplanview.com, which I didn't have interest
to maintain anymore. The appengine stuff was some grand plan I never really
threw time into.

This project is old technology (no parser for the json plan format, no support
for CTEs, 10-years old web technology at the time of writing this) and
virtually unchanged code since 2010.  But someone used the tool and kindly
asked if I had plans to open source it.  So here it is. Maybe someone else
wants to maintain it?

Have fun.

I still like giving headache to lawyers and to selfish people in general.
